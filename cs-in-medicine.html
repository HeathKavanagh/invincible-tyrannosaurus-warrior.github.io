        <p>
          Relatively old technology that has been around for decades, this section will give a brief overfiew on how it has positively impacted the field of medicine. <br>
        </p>
        <span class="subheading">How does CAD work?</span>
        <p>
          CAD systems assist doctors in the interpretation of medical images by processing digital videos/images and providing an input. A few Intelligent CAD systems can even use artificial intelligence, computer vision, data mining and machine learning to analyze massive/complex clinical data.
        </p>
        <span class = "subheading">How CAD has had a positive impact: <br></span>
        <span class=  "subheading">Managing large volumes of clinical data -<br></span>
        <p>
          As clinical data becomes more complicated, and too large for humans to comprehend. CAD offers great help in reducing time and making decisions and connecting disease/patient registries. 
        </p>
        <span class = "subheading">Objective and quantitative judgement -<br></span>
        Unfortunately traditional human-based diagnostic approaches can be subjective and or inaccurate, which can be affected by their:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="subheading">Experience –</span> some healthcare professionals are inexperienced/poorly trained and or some basics skills like Auscultation (listening and interpreting sounds coming from organs) take years of training and experience to master, unfortunately it’s hard to teach in a structured way and many programs offer poor or little to no training for such skills.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class = "subheading">Fatigue –</span> a lot of medical professionals work long hours and go overtime, and fatigue can lead to the worsening of their performance and decision making, under such circumstance human error is almost unavoidable.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          CAD can assist in relieving the pressure of the medical professionals by being able to make objective diagnostic decisions consistently and can help narrow the gap between the experienced and inexperienced healthcare professionals.
        </p>
        <span class = "subheading">Effectiveness and efficiency -</span>
        <p>
          Most of asymptomatic diseases are easily treatable in early stages. However, when the disease progresses, most common treatment is an invasive procedure which may involve high costs, physical pain, emotional distress. Also in the later stages of the disease, treatment are often less effective and unable to rebuild the full functionality of the the organs affected. CAD can help detect (asymptomatic) diseases at an early stage, by detecting micro changes in a patients condition, many hospitals and clinics already use this for breast cancer screening.

        <span class = "heading">VR and AR</span>
        <p>
          A new and possibly emerging technology, not much is known about it yet, but this section will go through the potential use of VR and AR in medicine. <br> 
          <b>VR</b> - Virtual Reality, a technology that immerses the user in a synthetic 3D environment via wearable screens in the form of VR headsets. <br>
          <b>AR</b> - Augmented Reality, uses elements of VR and superimposes them on to the real world environment in real time displayed through a screen.

        <span class="subheading">Potential uses of VR and AR: <br></span>
        <span class="subheading">Medical training and education</span>
        <p>
          In general, it has the potential to help students learn more efficiently and solve moral and ethical issues - with the help of AR and VR games like "Touch Surgery", trainees can conduct virtual surgeries to help improve their surgical skills and reduce errors without the risk of a patient getting hurt. Moreover, with virtual surgeries, medical schools can avoid the usage of cadavars for practical training.
        </p>
        <span class="subheading">Inhospital and remote surgery</span>
        <p>
          Before the surgery, we can do 3D body mapping via an MRI scan, and use this to help plan complicated complex operations. Then during the operation it can help guide doctors by overlaying the image with the patient, quite literally allowing the doctors to visualise their patient's anatomy potentially lowering the risks that might arise during surgery. Furthermore, with this technology surgeons can possibly perform surgeries remotely, allowing specialized surgeons being available around the world without the need for patients to travel beyond their local hospital.
        </p>
        <span class="subheading">Mental health treatment</span>
        <p>
          Currently AR/VR's most widely used in mental health practices to conduct exposure therapy, this provides a more immersive, controlled way of helping patients e.g. veterans with PTSD, with confronting and overcoming their fears, or at least decreasing the intensity of the stress response you might have in those situations, in a safe environment.
