        <h1>Computer science has made significant contributions 
            to the field of communication in various ways. <br /><br />Here are five examples:</h1>

        <p>1. Internet and World Wide Web:</p>

        <p class="pa">Computer science played a pivotal role in the development of
             the internet and the World Wide Web. Researchers and engineers in this
              field developed the protocols and technologies that enable data to be
               transmitted across the globe, allowing for instant communication 
               through email, web browsing, and social media.</pa>

        </button>
        
    
        <p>2. Data Compression:</p>

        <p class="pa">Data compression algorithms, such as those used in JPEG for 
            images and MP3 for audio, are products of computer science. These algorithms
             reduce the size of digital files, making it faster and more efficient to 
             transmit data, which is essential for multimedia communication.</pa>

        </button>
        
        <p>3. Network Protocols:</p>

        <p class="pa">Computer scientists have developed various network protocols,
             like TCP/IP, which are the backbone of the internet. These protocols 
             ensure reliable data transmission, and they've been fundamental in 
             establishing a robust and interconnected global communication infrastructure.</pa>

        <p>4. Cryptography:</p>

        <p class="pa">Cryptography, a vital part of computer science, is crucial for secure
             communication. It's used to encrypt data and protect it from unauthorized access.
              Secure communication methods such as SSL/TLS, which underlie secure websites, 
              rely heavily on cryptographic techniques.</pa>

        </button>

        <p>5. Voice and Video Communication:</p>

        <p class="pa">Computer science has enabled real-time voice and video communication
             through technologies like VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) and video 
             conferencing software. These tools, which run on computer networks, have transformed
              how people communicate for work, education, and personal connections.</pa>
